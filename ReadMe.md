<h1> Notes on Designing Data-Intensive Applications </h1>

DDIA has become arguably the go-to book for solid backend engineering, and how to do it. So many articles online, so many videos on YouTube, are simply explicating chapters or sections of it (either with acknowledgements or without acknowledgements). 

Over the last year or so, I've read isolated chapters of it, and picked it up where it's been needed whenever I've encountered issues at work that would be helped my a deeper understanding of parts that DDIA covers. But I think it's a book that I should probably have a good grasp of - in at least the major sections. 

So, this repo is my notes and summaries of chapters of the book that I have chosen to look at in-depth.

I also fully intend to use this space to discuss any concepts or ideas that are presented in DDIA that I find interesting or worth mentioning. Potentially expect rabbit-hole dives of certain threads discussed in DDIA.
